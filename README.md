# WeavingDesignWebpage
 Simple webpage for planning out color designs for vertical and diagonal weaving patterns

 Initial commit allows for basic color layouts for both vertical and diagonal weave structures and switching between Over/Under and Under/Over.

 Current limitations are the design only goes Left to Right and has a set number of warp ends (24), and colors are changed via toggle (rather than a picker). Additional functionality will be added later.
