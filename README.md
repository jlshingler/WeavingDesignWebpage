# WeavingDesignWebpage
 Simple webpage for planning out color designs for vertical and diagonal warp-faced weaving patterns (specifically for Amtgard Fingerwoven Belts, but can be applied to other weaving styles, especially the vertical weave).

 Initial commit allows for basic color layouts for both vertical and diagonal weave structures and switching between Over/Under and Under/Over.

 New additions Jan 24 2023: Diagonal Weave for both Left to Right and Right to Left. Allow for a range of warp ends/columns. Also tweaked some styling.

 Current limitations are the colors are changed via toggle (rather than a picker), and there is still a limited number of weave/design types. Additional functionality will be added later.
